                        the height of almost 100 feet. </td>

                  America. Since this tree grows quite rapidly, it is often used for its high quality lumber.
                  Although, this tree grows the best in moist, deep soils, it can do well in other types of
                        soils as well. The wood of the tree is evenly grained, soft, light, but strong. </td>
